The purpose of this mini project is for you to write a function to calculate the conditional market VWAP (volume-weighted average price) corresponding to a set of client orders.
The implicit/required underlying data consist of 2 tables
1.      1. a clientorders table with the following columns: `id`version`sym`time`side`limit`start`end. Each record in this table corresponds to a client order. sym is the financial instrument corresponding to that order and start/end are timestamps denoting the order lifetime (.e.g order with id=1 starts at 2021.01.01D09:00 and ends at 2021.01.01.D10:30). side denotes whether the order is requesting to buy or sell the instrument and limit is the limit price (ie buy at most at this price, or sell at least at this price). Each order has a unique id and the limit price of an order may change over time, in which case its version will increment. If the limit does change for an id, you can assume that the start/end times are unaffected, ie as per the initial order's version start and end time.
2.      2. a markettrades table with the following columns: `sym`time`price`volume. sym is again the financial instrument, whereas price and volume denotes the market traded price and size at the time. 

 
Conditional market VWAP for a given order, is defined as the market vwap during the lifetime of a client order, which is conditional (ie within the limit) to that order's limit price at the time
 
Acceptance Criteria:
§  - Your function will take a client order and market trades tables as inputs and return a table which contains one record per client id , the sym,start and end columns, and an extra column, the conditional vwap described above.
§  - The function should be tested using your testing framework of your choice and an example should be given on how to run the tests.
§  - A sample/example run of the function with some input/output should be documented (it can be the tests above).
§  Treat the structure of the data and code as if it is production quality code that needs to run in a stable and supportable manner.
§  - The q files and all required code/tests should be sent over as a compressed file with instructions on how to run.
